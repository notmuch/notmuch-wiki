## How come this query matches mails in folder:2013? `notmuch search --output=files folder:inbox`

You have duplicates of a message (or messages) in both folders.

Notmuch searches are message based. Multiple files may be associated
with the same message (i.e. the files have identical Message-ID). A
`folder:` search will match the folder of any of the files. The
`--output=files` option outputs all the files of all matching messages.

## Shouldn't notmuch support inline PGP?

[Why it might not be a good idea](https://dkg.fifthhorseman.net/notes/inline-pgp-harmful/)

## How do I delete messages

See [[excluding]].

## How do I configure the citation line when replying in Emacs?

        (setq message-citation-line-format "On %a, %d %b %Y, %f wrote:")
        (setq message-citation-line-function 'message-insert-formatted-citation-line)

See help for `message-citation-line-format` for details.

## How do I search for messages that have no tags?

Unfortunately, there is no way to do this directly.

However, it's possible to accomplish this using two searches in shell. First,
you need to query all tags in the database, and transform the result into a
query that matches messages that have none of those tags:

        $ notmuch search --output=tags \* | sed 's/^/not tag:/;2~1s/^/and /'

Next, use that to query the messages:

        $ notmuch search $(notmuch search --output=tags \* | \
                sed 's/^/not tag:/;2~1s/^/and /')

## How do I search for punctuation, specific special characters, or regexp?

Please see the [[notmuch-search-terms manual
page|manpages/notmuch-search-terms-7]] first.

The main thing to understand is that Xapian, and therefore Notmuch, searches are
closer to natural language searches than regular expression
searches. Punctuation is mostly ignored.

The boolean prefix searches (see Boolean and Probabilistic Prefixes in the man
page), such as tag: or path: searches, need an exact match.

## How do I search for the `List-Id:` header?

Currently there is no way to search for `List-Id:`. As a workaround, try using a
`to:` prefix search (which covers both `To:` and `Cc:` headers) on the mailing
list address.

Limitations in the duplicate message handling are the main reason for not
indexing the `List-Id:` header. If you receive the same message via both the
list and directly (by way of `To:` or `Cc:`), only the first message encountered
will be indexed. Only the message received via the list will have `List-Id:`,
but you would expect a `List-Id:` search to find the message, regardless of the
order in which the duplicates were received. This is a more general problem than
just `List-Id:`, and once this has been resolved, adding `List-Id:` indexing is
trivial.
