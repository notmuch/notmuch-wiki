# Getting Started with Notmuch

*This is a work in progress.*

[[!toc levels=2]]

This is your friendly guide and tutorial to getting started with Notmuch. It
will help you through the first steps of setting up Notmuch.

## Prerequisites

In order to use Notmuch, you will need to have your email messages stored in
your local filesystem, one message per file. For example,
[Maildir](http://cr.yp.to/proto/maildir.html), Maildir++, and MH formats work
like this, while [mbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox) does not. Storing
the messages one message per file is the only hard dependency for trying out
Notmuch.

We will get back to delivering messages later, for now we'll just assume you
already have messages in this format.

## Installation

On Linux, the easiest way to install Notmuch is through your distribution's
package repository. If you're installing Notmuch from a [git
checkout](http://git.notmuchmail.org/git/notmuch) or a [source
release](http://notmuchmail.org/releases/), please refer to the
[INSTALL](http://git.notmuchmail.org/git/notmuch/blob/HEAD:/INSTALL) document.

## Configuration

To configure Notmuch, just run

    notmuch

This will interactively guide you through the setup process, and save the
configuration to `$HOME/.notmuch-config`. If you'd like to change the
configuration in the future, you can either edit that file directly, or run
`notmuch setup`.

This step only modifies the configuration file.

## Initial Indexing

Notmuch needs a search database to operate. The next step is to run

    notmuch new

to index all your messages in the search database. The database will be stored
in `.notmuch` directory under your mail store. The database is not a replacement
or storage for your messages; it's just an index to find the right message
files.

Notmuch does not modify or delete your mails. This is one of the main design
principles of Notmuch. (The only exception is renaming files upon tagging
according to the Maildir specification if the `maildir.synchronize_flags`
configuration option is set.) It should be safe to try Notmuch.

Depending on the amount of mail you have the initial indexing process can take a
long time, so expect that. Also, the resulting database will require roughly the
same amount of storage space as your current collection of email.

After this step, you can try out the [[Notmuch command-line
interface|manpages]], or [[Notmuch Emacs interface|notmuch-emacs]].
