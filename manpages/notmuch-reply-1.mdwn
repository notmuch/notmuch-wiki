<h1>NOTMUCH-REPLY(1)</h1>

<h2>NAME</h2>
<pre>
       notmuch-reply - constructs a reply template for a set of messages
</pre>

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<pre>
       <b>notmuch</b> <b>reply</b> [option ...] &lt;<u>search-term</u>&gt; ...
</pre>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<pre>
       Constructs a reply template for a set of messages.

       To  make  replying to email easier, <b>notmuch</b> <b>reply</b> takes an existing set
       of messages and constructs a suitable mail template. Its To: address is
       set  according  to  the  original  email  in this way: if the Reply-to:
       header is present and different from any To:/Cc: address  it  is  used,
       otherwise  From: header is used. Unless <b>--reply-to=sender</b> is specified,
       values from the To: and Cc: headers are copied, but not  including  any
       of the current user&apos;s email addresses (as configured in primary_mail or
       other_email in the .notmuch-config file) in the recipient list.

       It also builds a suitable new subject, including Re: at the  front  (if
       not  already present), and adding the message IDs of the messages being
       replied to to the References list and setting  the  In-Reply-To:  field
       correctly.

       Finally,  the  original  contents of the emails are quoted by prefixing
       each line with &apos;&gt; &apos; and included in the body.

       The resulting message template is output to stdout.

       Supported options for <b>reply</b> include

       <b>--format=</b>(<b>default</b>|<b>json</b>|<b>sexp</b>|<b>headers-only</b>)

              <b>default</b>
                     Includes subject and quoted message body as an  RFC  2822
                     message.

              <b>json</b>   Produces  JSON output containing headers for a reply mes‐
                     sage and the contents of the original message. This  out‐
                     put  can  be  used  by a client to create a reply message
                     intelligently.

              <b>sexp</b>   Produces S-Expression output  containing  headers  for  a
                     reply  message  and the contents of the original message.
                     This output can be used by a client  to  create  a  reply
                     message intelligently.

              <b>headers-only</b>
                     Only  produces  In-Reply-To,  References, To, Cc, and Bcc
                     headers.

       <b>--format-version=N</b>
              Use the specified structured  output  format  version.  This  is
              intended  for  programs  that  invoke  <a href='../notmuch-1/'>notmuch</a>(1) internally. If
              omitted, the latest supported version will be used.

       <b>--reply-to=</b>(<b>all</b>|<b>sender</b>)

              <b>all</b> (default)
                     Replies to all addresses.

              <b>sender</b> Replies only to the sender. If  replying  to  user&apos;s  own
                     message  (Reply-to:  or From: header is one of the user&apos;s
                     configured email addresses), try To:, Cc:, and Bcc: head‐
                     ers  in  this  order, and copy values from the first that
                     contains something other than only the user&apos;s addresses.

       <b>--decrypt=(false|auto|true)</b>
          If <b>true</b>, decrypt any MIME encrypted parts found in the selected con‐
          tent  (i.e.,  &quot;multipart/encrypted&quot; parts). Status of the decryption
          will be reported (currently only supported  with  --format=json  and
          --format=sexp), and on successful decryption the multipart/encrypted
          part will be replaced by the decrypted content.

          If <b>auto</b>, and a session key is already known for the message, then it
          will  be  decrypted,  but  notmuch will not try to access the user&apos;s
          secret keys.

          Use <b>false</b> to avoid even automatic decryption.

          Non-automatic decryption expects a functioning <b>gpg-agent</b>(1) to  pro‐
          vide any needed credentials. Without one, the decryption will likely
          fail.

          Default: <b>auto</b>

       See <a href='../notmuch-search-terms-7/'>notmuch-search-terms</a>(7) for details of  the  supported  syntax  for
       &lt;search-terms&gt;.

       Note:  It  is  most  common  to  use <b>notmuch</b> <b>reply</b> with a search string
       matching a single message, (such as id:&lt;message-id&gt;),  but  it  can  be
       useful to reply to several messages at once. For example, when a series
       of patches are sent in a single thread, replying to the  entire  thread
       allows  for  the  reply to comment on issues found in multiple patches.
       The default format supports replying to multiple messages at once,  but
       the JSON and S-Expression formats do not.
