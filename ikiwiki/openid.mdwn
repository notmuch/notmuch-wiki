[OpenID](http://openid.net) is a decentralized authentication mechanism
that allows you to have one login that you can use on a growing number of
websites.

To sign up for an OpenID, visit one of the following identity providers:

* [MyOpenID](https://www.myopenid.com/)
* [GetOpenID](https://getopenid.com/)
* [LiveJournal](http://www.livejournal.com/openid/)
* [TrustBearer](https://openid.trustbearer.com/)
* or any of the [many others out there](http://openiddirectory.com/openid-providers-c-1.html)

Your OpenID is the URL that you are given when you sign up.
[[!if test="enabled(openid)" then="""
To sign in to this wiki using OpenID, just enter it in the OpenID field in the
signin form. You do not need to give this wiki a password or go through any
registration process when using OpenID.

It's also possible to make a page in the wiki usable as an OpenID url,
by delegating it to an openid server. Here's an example of how to do that:

	\[[!meta openid="http://yourid.myopenid.com/"
	       server="http://www.myopenid.com/server"]]
