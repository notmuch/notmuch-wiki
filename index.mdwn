# Notmuch -- Just an email system

If you've been looking for a fast, global-search and tag-based email
system to use within your text editor or in a terminal...

If you're the kind of person that gets excited about being able to
write shell scripts for exploring and manipulating your email...

If you're a developer of an existing email program and would love a
good library interface for fast, global search with support for
arbitrary tags...

If you want the convenience of fast, reliable search of all your
email, but don't want to give a 3rd-party access to your email...

Then notmuch may be exactly what you've been looking for.

## Why is it named Notmuch?

* "Not much mail" is what Notmuch thinks about your email
  collection. Even if you receive 12000 messages per month or have on
  the order of millions of messages that you've been saving for
  decades. Regardless, Notmuch will be able to quickly search all of
  it. It's just plain not much mail.

* "Not much mail" is also what you should have in your inbox at any
  time. Notmuch gives you what you need, (tags and fast search), so
  that you can keep your inbox tamed and focus on what really matters
  in your life, (which is surely not email).

* Notmuch is an answer to [Sup](http://sup-heliotrope.github.io/).
  Sup is a very good email program written by William Morgan (and
  others) and is the direct inspiration for Notmuch. Notmuch began as
  an effort to rewrite performance-critical pieces of Sup in C rather
  than Ruby. From there, it grew into a separate project. One
  significant contribution Notmuch makes compared to Sup is the
  separation of the indexer/searcher from the user interface. (Notmuch
  provides a library interface so that its indexing/searching/tagging
  features can be integrated into any email program.)

* Notmuch is not much of an email program. It doesn't receive messages
  (no POP or IMAP support). It doesn't send messages (no mail composer,
  no network code at all). And for what it does do (email search) that
  work is provided by an external library,
  [Xapian](http://xapian.org).  So if Notmuch provides no user
  interface and Xapian does all the heavy lifting, then what's left
  here? Not much.
