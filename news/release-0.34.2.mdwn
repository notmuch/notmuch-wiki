Notmuch 0.34.2 (2021-12-09)
===========================

Library
-------

Fix a bug that wrongly resolved conflict between the `database_path`
parameter to `notmuch_database_open_with_config` and configuration
item `database.path` in favour of the latter.

Python Bindings (notmuch2)
--------------------------

When building the documentation for the `notmuch2` python module,
import from the built module, not a system wide installed one.

The notmuch2.Database constructor now uses the library function
`notmuch_database_open_with_config` to support the same configuration
and database location options as the library does.

Fix some unprintable exception objects.
