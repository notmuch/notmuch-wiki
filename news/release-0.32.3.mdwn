Notmuch 0.32.3 (2021-08-17)
===========================

Library
-------

Restore location of database via `MAILDIR` environment variable, which
was broken in 0.32.

Bump libnotmuch minor version to match the documentation in
`notmuch.h`.

Correct documentation for deprecated database opening functions to
point out that they (still) do not load configuration information.

CLI
---

Restore "notmuch config get built_with.*", which was broken in 0.32.
