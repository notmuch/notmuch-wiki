Notmuch 0.33 (2021-09-03)
=========================

Library
-------

Correct documentation about transactions.

Add a configurable automatic commit of transactions. See
`database.autocommit` in notmuch-config(1).

Document the algorithm used to find a database.

CLI
---

Define format version 5, which supports sorting the output of
notmuch-show.

Emacs
-----

`notmuch` no longer sets `mail-user-agent` on load. To restore the
previous behaviour of using notmuch to send mail by default, customize
`mail-user-agent` to `notmuch-user-agent`.

`notmuch-company` now works in `org-msg`.

Improve the display of messages from long threads in unthreaded mode.

Prefer email addresses over User ID when showing valid signatures.

Define a new face `notmuch-jump-key`.

New commands in notmuch-tree view: `notmuch-tree-filter` and `notmuch-tree-filter-by-tag`.

Honour `notmuch-show-text/html-blocked-images` when using `w3m` to
render html.

Support toggling sort order in notmuch-tree mode.

Ruby
----

Memory management of allocated notmuch objects (database, messages,
etc...) is now done via the Ruby GC. This removes all constraints on
the order of object destruction.  Database close and destroy are
split, following an old library API change.

Vim
---

Respect excluded tags when showing a thread.

Documentation
-------------

Fix doc build for Sphinx 4.0.

Improve the markup and linking of the documentation.
