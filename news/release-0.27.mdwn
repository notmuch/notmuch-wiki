Notmuch 0.27 (2018-06-13)
=========================

General
-------

### Add support for thread:{} queries

Queries of the form `thread:{foo} and thread:{bar}` match threads
containing (possibly distinct) messages matching foo and bar. See
`notmuch-search-terms(7)` for details.

Command Line Interface
----------------------

### Add the --full-scan option to `notmuch new`

This option disables mtime based optimization of scanning for new mail.

### Add new --decrypt=stash option for `notmuch show`

This facilitates a workflow for encrypted messages where message
cleartext are indexed on first read, but the user's decryption key
does not have to be available during message receipt.

Documentation
-------------

An initial manual for `notmuch-emacs` is now installed by default (in
`info` format).

Dependencies
------------

As of this release, support for versions of Xapian before 1.4.0 is
deprecated, and may disappear in a future release of notmuch.
