Notmuch 0.23.1 (2016-10-23)
===========================

General
-------

### Require Xapian >= 1.2.6

The ifdef branch for older Xapian (pre-compact API) had bit-rotted.

Emacs
-----

### Fix default colours for unread and flagged messages

In 0.23 the default colours for unread and flagged messages in
search view were accidentally swapped. This release returns them to
the original colours.

A related change in 0.23 broke the customize widget for
notmuch-search-line-faces. This is now fixed.

### Fix test failure with Emacs 25.1

A previously undiscovered jit-lock related bug was exposed by Emacs
25, causing a notmuch-show mode test to fail. This release fixes the
bug, and hence the test.
