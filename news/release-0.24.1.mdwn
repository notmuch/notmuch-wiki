Notmuch 0.24.1 (2017-04-01)
===========================

General
-------

### Fix regressions in non-regexp search for `from:` and `subject:`

The regexp search code in 0.24 introduced a regression in the
handling of empty queries and wildcards. These are both corrected in
this release.

Command Line Interface
----------------------

### Fix several memory leaks in `notmuch show`

### Update NEWS for 0.24 to mention schema changes

### Fix bug in dump header

The previous version of the dump header failed to mention the
inclusion of tags. This fix bumps the version number of the dump
format to 3. There are no other changes to the format.

Library Changes
