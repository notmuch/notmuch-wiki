===========================

Test Suite
----------

Drop use of gpgconf --create-socketdir. Move $GNUPGHOME to /tmp.

It turns out the hardcoded use of /run/user in gpg doesn't work out
that well in some environments. The more low tech fix is to move all
of $GNUPGHOME to somewhere where we can control the length of the
paths.
