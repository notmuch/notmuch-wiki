An optional new s-expression based query parser is available if

s-expression query support.

CLI
---

Support multiple `Delivered-To` headers in notmuch-reply(1).

Emacs
-----

Functions are now allowed in `notmuch-search-result-format`.

Improvements to unthreaded view on large threads.

Allow customization of tree drawing symbols in notmuch-tree mode.
