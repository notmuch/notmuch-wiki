Notmuch 0.30 (2020-06-01)
=========================

S/MIME
------

Handle S/MIME (PKCS#7) messages -- one-part signed messages, encrypted
messages, and multilayer messages. Treat them symmetrically to
OpenPGP messages. This includes handling protected headers
gracefully.

If you're using Notmuch with S/MIME, you currently need to configure
gpgsm appropriately.

Mixed-up MIME Repair
--------------------

Detect and automatically repair a common form of message mangling
created by Microsoft Exchange (see index.repaired=mixedup in
notmuch-properties(7)).

Protected Headers
-----------------

Avoid indexing the legacy-display part of an encrypted message that
has protected headers (see
index.repaired=skip-protected-headers-legacy-display in
notmuch-properties(7)).

Python
------

Drop support for python2, focus on python3.

Introduce new CFFI-based python bindings in the python module named
"notmuch2".  Officially deprecate (but still support) the older
"notmuch" module.

Dependencies
------------

Support for Xapian 1.2 is removed. The minimum supported version of
Xapian is now 1.4.0.
