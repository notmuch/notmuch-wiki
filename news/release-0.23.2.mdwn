Notmuch 0.23.2 (2016-11-20)
===========================

Emacs
-----

Fix notmuch-interesting-buffer and notmuch-cycle-notmuch-buffers.

notmuch-tree-mode and notmuch-message-mode buffers are now
considered interesting by `notmuch-interesting-buffer` and
`notmuch-cycle-notmuch-buffers`.

Restore compatibility with Emacs 23.

Notmuch support for Emacs 23 is now deprecated.
