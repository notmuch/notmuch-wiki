Notmuch 0.34.1 (2021-11-03)
===========================

Library
-------

Fix for deallocation and nulling of output parameter for
notmuch_database_{open_with,create_with,load}_config when errors
occur. This change fixes a potential use-after-free bug that has been
present since 0.32. This release also improves the documentation of
status returns for the same 3 functions.
